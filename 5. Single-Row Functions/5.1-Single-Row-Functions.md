# Single-Row and Multiple-Row Functions:

Functions are created for manipulating the data and returning a value. They allow us to reuse the code
any time we want just calling the function name, instead of writting the whole code over and over again.


- **Single-Row Functions:** it gets 1 input and returns 1 output

- **Multiple-Row Functions:** it gets multiple inputs and returns 1 output

They can be used alone or nested, and a column or and expression can be used as arguments. They can be used in SELECT, WHERE or ORDER BY clause.


## CATEGORIES OF FUNCTIONS:


- **Character Functions:** accept character values as input, and return character or numeric values.

-  **Number Functions:** accept values as input and return numeric values as output.
  
- **Date Functions:** operate on values of the DATE data type.
  
- **Conversion Functions:** these functions take in any data type. But, they are mainly used to handle the *NULL* values


### **Example:**

~~~sql
SELECT function_name[(arg1, arg2, ...)] FROM dual;
~~~

### Calling a function:

~~~sql
function_name[(arg1, arg2, ...)]
